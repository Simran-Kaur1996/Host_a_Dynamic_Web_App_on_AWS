###AWS Dynamic Website Hosting with DevOps Practices
This project demonstrates the deployment and hosting of a dynamic website on AWS, utilizing various AWS services to ensure high availability, scalability, security, and fault tolerance. The infrastructure includes a combination of EC2, VPC, load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring services to provide a robust and scalable web hosting environment.

###Architecture Overview
The website is hosted on EC2 instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configured with both public and private subnets across two Availability Zones. The infrastructure utilizes the following AWS resources:

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A logically isolated section of AWS cloud where AWS resources are deployed.
Internet Gateway: Provides internet connectivity to VPC instances.
Security Groups: Acts as a firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
Availability Zones: The infrastructure spans two availability zones for increased fault tolerance and high availability.
Public Subnets: Hosts infrastructure components like the NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
Private Subnets: Hosts EC2 instances (web servers) to enhance security.
NAT Gateway: Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet for updates or other communications.
EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint: Enables secure connections to EC2 instances within both public and private subnets.
Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming web traffic to EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling group.
Auto Scaling Group: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic load, ensuring elasticity and fault tolerance.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): Secures application traffic using SSL/TLS certificates.
Simple Notification Service (SNS): Sends notifications regarding activities within the Auto Scaling Group.
Route 53: Manages DNS records and domain name registration.
Amazon S3: Stores application code and assets.
Deployment Instructions
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following:

AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
AWS CLI installed and configured.
GitHub repository cloned to your local machine.
Steps
Clone the GitHub Repository: Clone the repository containing the deployment scripts and reference diagrams.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```
Set Up the Required AWS Resources: Follow the instructions in the repositoryâ€™s documentation to set up the AWS resources. This includes creating the VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Group, and configuring the Load Balancer.

Deploy Website Code to S3: Store your application code and assets in an S3 bucket. The application files will be synced with EC2 instances from this bucket.

bash
Copy code
aws s3 sync ./app-code s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>/
Deploy Website on EC2: After the EC2 instances are set up, use the following script to install the necessary software (Apache, PHP, MySQL) and deploy the application on EC2.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd

Install PHP and required extensions
sudo dnf install -y php php-pdo php-openssl php-mbstring php-exif php-fileinfo php-xml php-ctype php-json php-tokenizer php-curl php-cli php-fpm php-mysqlnd php-bcmath php-gd php-cgi php-gettext php-intl php-zip

Install and configure MySQL 8
sudo dnf install -y mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2023
sudo dnf install -y mysql-community-server
sudo systemctl start mysqld
sudo systemctl enable mysqld

Download and extract application code from S3
sudo aws s3 sync s3://<your-s3-bucket-name> /var/www/html
sudo unzip /var/www/html/shopwise.zip -d /var/www/html/

Set appropriate permissions
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html/storage

Restart Apache server to apply changes
sudo service httpd restart
Configure the Database: Use Flyway to migrate the database schema from the SQL file stored in S3 to your RDS instance.

bash
Copy code
Configure Flyway
sudo wget https://download.red-gate.com/maven/release/com/redgate/flyway/flyway-commandline/10.9.1/flyway-commandline-10.9.1-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar -xvz
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/flyway-10.9.1/flyway /usr/local/bin

Migrate Database
flyway -url=jdbc:mysql://<RDS_ENDPOINT>:3306/<RDS_DB_NAME> -user=<RDS_DB_USERNAME> -password=<RDS_DB_PASSWORD> -locations=filesystem:/sql migrate
Configure Auto Scaling & Load Balancer: Set up the Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group to ensure high availability and load balancing.

Set Up SNS Notifications: Configure Amazon SNS to send notifications about scaling activities.

DNS Configuration: Use Route 53 to register a domain name and point it to the Application Load Balancer.

bash

aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <zone_id> --change-batch file://dns_config.json
Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. Challenge: EC2 Instances in Private Subnets Not Accessible for Web Traffic
Issue: I deployed EC2 instances in private subnets for enhanced security, but they couldn't receive web traffic because the load balancer was not correctly routing the traffic to the instances in the private subnet.
Solution: I configured the Application Load Balancer to route traffic to EC2 instances within the private subnet. Additionally, I placed the NAT Gateway in a public subnet to ensure EC2 instances in the private subnet could access the internet for updates.
2. Challenge: Insufficient Database Connections
Issue: The MySQL database hosted on RDS was experiencing connection issues due to excessive concurrent requests.
Solution: I increased the max_connections parameter in MySQL and optimized queries to handle a higher load. Additionally, I implemented an Auto Scaling Group for EC2 instances to handle increased web traffic efficiently, thereby reducing the load on the database.
3. Challenge: Incorrect Permissions for S3 Bucket
Issue: During deployment, the EC2 instances failed to access the application files stored in S3 due to restrictive permissions on the bucket.
Solution: I modified the S3 Bucket Policy to allow EC2 instances to access the files by creating an appropriate IAM Role with S3 read permissions and attaching it to the EC2 instances.
4. Challenge: Application Not Available After Deployment
Issue: After deploying the website code to EC2 instances, the site was not accessible due to missing dependencies and incorrect configurations in the EC2 instances.
Solution: I created a script to automatically install necessary software (Apache, PHP, MySQL) and configure the EC2 instance to serve the website. I also ensured the security groups allowed HTTP/HTTPS traffic on port 80 and 443.
5. Challenge: SSL Certificate Installation Failures
Issue: There were issues with installing and configuring the SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS communication.
Solution: I used AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage the SSL certificates. After validating the domain in Route 53, I reconfigured the load balancer to handle HTTPS traffic and ensured the proper certificate was applied.
